<!-- append down the actual method we want to handle this action. this ?_method is essentially 
defining a query parameter and we will set it equal to delete-->
<!-- When ou server gets this request, it is going to know that it is a POST request but then it
is going to see _method which will inform it  that the DELETE method or request should override the POST request--> 

<form method="POST" action="<%= url %>?_method=DELETE">
    <!-- this is inside of a form so that we can use the delete method instead of a get method--> 
    
    <button class="btn btn-danger" type="submit">Delete</button>
</form>
